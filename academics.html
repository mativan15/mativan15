        I am studying Computer Science at UCSP, currently in second semester. In my first semester I performed pretty good regarding my grades. The courses I took were:
        <ul style="list-style-type: square; color: rgb(193,194,194);"class="normal-text">
            <br><li> Discrete Structures: Discrete structures provide the theoretical foundations necessary for computation. These fundamentals are not only
                useful to develop computation from a theoretical point of view as it happens in the course of computational theory,
                but also is useful for the practice of computing; In particular in applications such as verification, cryptography, formal
                methods, etc.</li>
            <br><li> Videogames Programming: This is the first course in the sequence of introductory courses to Computer Science.This course is intended to cover the
                concepts outlined by the Computing Curricula IEEE-CS/ACM 2013. Programming is one of the pillars of Computer
                Science; any professional of the area, will need to program to materialize their models and proposals. This course
                introduces participants to the fundamental concepts of this art. Topics include data types, control structures, functions,
                lists, recursion, and the mechanics of execution, testing, and debugging.
                </li>
            <br><li> Mathematics I: The course aims to develop in students the skills to deal with models in science and engineering related to single variable
                differential calculus skills. In the course it is studied and applied concepts related to calculation limits, derivatives and
                integrals of real and vector functions of single real variables to be used as base and support for the study of new contents
                and subjects. Also seeks to achieve reasoning capabilities and applicability to interact with real-world problems by
                providing a mathematical basis for further professional development activities.
                </li>
            <br><li> Communication: To ensure effective communication in both personal and professional settings, mastering language skills,
                 both oral and written, is a top priority for UCSP University students. Understanding and applying language concepts and skills, such as 
                 listening, speaking, reading, and writing, are essential for their academic development and future professional success.
                </li>
            <br><li>  Study Methodology: Vocational students should improve their work ethic and academic commitment. They need to understand the 
                mental process of studying, adapt their approach, and master various study methods to suit their learning style and subjects. Additionally, they 
                should know how to find academic information and complete formal academic work, which will help them succeed in their university studies.
            </li>
            <br><li> Introduction to University Life: University entrance is a time of new challenges and decisions. UCSP aims to welcome and 
                guide new students, , presenting the university's identity and mission as their 'alma mater', helping them develop personally and culturally to become successful professionals and agents of change.</li>
