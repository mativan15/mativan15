    <p style="color: rgb(193,194,194);"class="normal-text">    
        I was born in Arequipa, Peru, in 2005. I attended my 11 years of school at '<a href="https://www.colegiosanjeronimo.edu.pe/" style="color: rgb(91,195,235); text-decoration: none;" onclick=this.style.color = rgb(73,126,141);>IEP San Jerónimo</a>', where I finished top 10 in academic performance.
        While in school, the subjects I excelled in were Mathematics, where I participated in national competitions numerous years, 
        Computer Science and English, where I participated in events for my school.
        <br><br>
        It was in 2022 that I finished my secondary and went to college, but I wasn't sure about my career path. 
        I first study Engineering, however this wasn't what I thought so the next year I myself searched for other subjects I might be good at.
        That's when I discover Computer Science at the <a href="https://ucsp.edu.pe/" style="color: rgb(91,195,235); text-decoration: none;" onclick=this.style.color = rgb(73,126,141);>Universidad Católica San Pablo</a>. I inmediately got enthralled by the degree and started planning my admission.
        <br><br>
        So in March of 2023, I was begining to study Computer Science. I was very nervous and excited but the degree and my life as a student at UCSP exceeded even my most optimistic expectations.
        I have really enjoyed my time at uni and I am very proud of my academic performance, which I detail more in the <a href="academics.html" style="color: rgb(91,195,235); text-decoration: none;" onclick=this.style.color = rgb(73,126,141);>Academics</a> tab.
        Even so, I was not satisfied with my academic performance only, so I decided to take part in alternative ways of learning more as a Computer Science student (congress, talks, hackatons, etc), which I will delve into in the <a href="academics.html" style="color: rgb(91,195,235); text-decoration: none;" onclick=this.style.color = rgb(73,126,141);>Academics</a> section.
        <br><br>
        However, my interests never limited to studies, I also started playing piano since I was 11 (I still play it today!). I even form a part of a rock band for a time!
        Another arts I got interested in is drawing and painting, I made works in pencil, charcoal, oil, acrylic, watercolor and pastel chalk.
        <br><br>
        I also enjoy sports, especially taekwondo, where I achieved a gold medal in a national tournament in Lima.
        Since the start of the pandemic, I discovered that I really enjoy playing volleyball so it become my second favourite sport, so much that I play it with my friends at college. 
        It's worth saying that, although I really love watching football matches (I'm truly a <a href="https://www.realmadrid.com" style="color: rgb(91,195,235); text-decoration: none;" onclick=this.style.color = rgb(73,126,141);>Real Madrid</a> fan), I am not a big fan of playing it.
        I like to keep healthy so I exercise every day, whether it's at the gym or playing the sports I like.
        Other things that I love doing are reading, going out with my friends, watching movies and series, and listening to music (a lot of it!).
        <br><br>
        Finally, I want to say that I am very excited about the future of my life and I am looking forward to expand my horizons every day.
